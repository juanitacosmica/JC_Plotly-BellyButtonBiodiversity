            <h4>What is the meaning of OTU?</h4>
            <p>
             It stands for Operational Taxonomic Unit.<br> 
             <br>
             OTU is the basic unit used in numerical taxonomy. These units may refer to an individual, species, genus, or class. In numerical methods, the taxonomic units used are constantly not comparable to the formal taxonomic units. Hence, the term operational taxonomic unit was coined. Since data is lacking on the correct OTUs in researches, various experiments have been conducted to evaluate the clustering method performance such as the rationality of OTU structure, the ability to cope with inflation of OTU, the stability of OTU, and the computational efficiency or runtime and memory requirements.

            <h4>What happens if you do not clean your bellybutton?</h4>
            <p>
              Cleaning your bellybutton can help you avoid potential infections, smells, and other results of poor hygiene. Problems such as: Yeast infection, smell, omphaloiths (Also known as a navel stone, they’re made of the same materials that form blackheads. The surface of a navel stone will turn black from oxidation. Naval stones aren’t typically pressured out like a blackhead, but removed with tweezers.). Most bellybuttons have crevices that can collect dirt and breed bacteria. Aim to clean yours about once a week using a cotton swab. When taking care of personal hygiene, we don’t often think about our bellybuttons.

          <h4>What has been researched about the bellybutton bacteria?</h4>
          <p>
            While scientists have researched things like how belly buttons affect attraction (most men seem to prefer shallow “innies,” according to one Finnish study), the most spectacular belly button research is on the microbial biodiversity inside them. In 2012, Rob Dunn and his colleagues at North Carolina State University examined the belly buttons of science writers who had attended scientific meetings in the area, and compared the belly buttons of people who attended a scientific conference a month later. Their paper, appropriately entitled “A Jungle in There: Bacteria in Belly Buttons are Highly Diverse, But Predictable,” describes the results of using next-generation sequencing approaches to determine the number and kinds of bacteria living in the belly buttons of the 60 people in the study from the two different events. Their findings show that the diversity of belly button aesthetics pales in comparison to the diversity of belly button microbe populations. The diversity that the researchers observed was spectacular—in the 60 different belly buttons surveyed, they found a total of nearly 2,400 phylotypes (a phylotype is shorthand in microbiome studies for “species”) of bacteria. The vast majority of these phylotypes (2,188) were found in fewer than 10 percent of the belly buttons studied. Even though there were 200 or so phylotypes found in more than 10 percent of the belly buttons, none of these were found in all belly buttons, and only eight phylotypes are found in more than 70 percent of the belly buttons. The authors of the work suggest that the belly button biodiversity is on par with the animal diversity in a jungle. A more complete understanding of belly button ecology and microbial diversity is forthcoming, but what we know so far is quite surprising.
