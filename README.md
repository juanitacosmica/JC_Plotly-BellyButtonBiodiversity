# JC_Plotly-BellyButtonBiodiversity
Module 12: Plotly & Belly Button Biodiversity

# Overview of the analysis:

The researcher has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. The volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, researcher's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

4 parts are accomplished through this challenge:

- D1: Showcase an Horizontal Bar Chart
- D2: Showcase a Bubble Chart
- D3: Showcase a Gauge Chart
- D4: Customize the Dashboard
